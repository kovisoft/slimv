INSTALLATION                                              *slimv-installation*

Prerequisites:
  - Lisp (any Common Lisp implementation should be OK) installed.
  - Python 2.4 or later installed.

To install the script:
  - Download the slimv.zip.
  - Extract the zip archive into your vimfiles or runtime directory.
    See Vim help file |usr_05.txt| for details on adding a plugin.
    The archive contains plugin/slimv.vim, plugin/slimv.py and doc/slimv.txt.
  - Start Vim or goto an existing instance of Vim.
  - Execute the following command:
>
      :helptag <your runtime directory/doc
<
    This will generate all the help tags for any file located in the doc
    directory.
  - Enter path definitions into your vimrc (if the default values are not
    valid for your Vim/Python/Lisp installation, which is highly probable).
    See |slimv-customization| below on how to do this.

Upgrade from previous script versions:
  No special upgrade actions are required.

                                                                *slimv_options*

Note: Most options below require to restart the Vim session when modified.

Slimv tries to autodetect the Python and Lisp installation directories,
however the algorithm is not very sophisticated.
If the installation directories are put in the path, then the autodetection
should find them (this is usually the case on Linux). Otherwise (on Windows)
some frequently used directories are searched under C:\ and C:\Program Files.
For a minimum, Slimv needs to know the path of the existing Python and Lisp
installations, so if autodetection does not work for you, then set the
following global variables in your vimrc.

Note: On Windows use the / (slash) character instead of \ (backslash) as the
      directory separator to avoid any incidental character escaping problems
      while the paths are beeing passed between the Slimv processes.
      On Linux this is not an issue.

                                                               *g:slimv_python*
This is the installation path of the Python interpreter.
Example:
    let g:slimv_python = 'C:/MyPythonDir/python.exe'

                                                                 *g:slimv_lisp*
This is the installation path of the Lisp interpreter.
Example:
    let g:slimv_lisp = 'C:/MyLispDir/mylisp.exe'

                                                                 *g:slimv_port*
The default port used by Slimv is 5151. If this port is used by another
program then set this variable to a free port number.
It is also possible to run multiple REPLs from multiple Vim processes, just
set a different port number for each Vim instance.
Example:
    let g:slimv_port = 10101

                                                               *g:slimv_client*
You may want to use a shell frontend other then the default one or put
additional command line parameters for starting the server.
In this case you can omit the variables above and use g:slimv_client instead.
This is the complete command that is used to start the client. If not set
by the user, this is automatically built from the variables above.

The command format is the following:
    <python> <slimv> -p <port> -r <server_cmd> -f <file_to_REPL>
Where:
    <python>       is the command to start the Python interpreter
    <slimv>        is the path of Slimv.py
    <port>         is the port number to use (if other than default)
    <server_cmd>   is the command to start the server
    <file_to_REPL> is the file containing Lisp forms to be sent to the REPL

The format of <server_cmd> is the following:
    <python> <slimv> -l <lisp> -s
Where:
    <python>       is the command to start the Python interpreter
    <slimv>        is the path of Slimv.py
    <lisp>         is the command to start the Lisp REPL
You can also pass the following shortcuts in <server_cmd>:
    @p             equals <python>
    @s             equals <slimv>
    @l             equals <lisp>
    @@             use it if you need to insert an @ character
    \"             use it to insert a " character

The reason behind the duplication of the <python> and <slimv> part is that
you may want to start the server/REPL in a shell frontend that needs
special command line options. For example on Windows I highly recommend
to use Console (http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/) which is greatly
configurable and you also get usable select/copy/paste functions.

Note: Remember to escape with a \ all " characters that are supposed to be
      inside a command line argument, otherwise the argument will be split
      by the shell.

Example to start the Slimv server via Console:

  let g:slimv_client = 
  \ 'python slimv.py -p 5152 -r "console -r \"/k @p @s -l clisp -s\""'

So the server will be started as if we typed at the command line:

  console -r "/k python slimv.py -l clisp -s"

                                                                *g:slimv_debug*
Defines the debug log level. Level 0 means no debug messages at all. The debug
messages go into the logfile defined by |slimv-logfile|.

                                                         *g:slimv_debug_client*
Set this to nonzero only if you want to keep the Slimv client window open.
Currently works only on Windows.

                                                              *g:slimv_logfile*
Name of the Slimv logfile. Defaults to slimv.log.

                                                          *g:slimv_keybindings*
Defines the keybinding set used by Slimv. Value 0 means no keybinding at all.
Value 1 defines the short keybinding with one-key bindings (after <Leader>).
Value 2 defines the easy keybinding with two-key bindings (after <Leader>).
Other values mean no predefined keybinding is wanted.

                                                                 *g:slimv_menu*
If nonzero then the Slimv menu us added to the end of the global menu.
Also the Slimv menu can be shown by pressing <Leader>, (defaults to ,,).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *slimv_templates*

Many Slimv commands are performed by creating a special Lisp form from the
selected symbol (or form) and send it to the REPL for execution.
Slimv defines various templates to build these special Lisp forms.
You can override them to suit your needs. Use %1 for substituting the selected
symbol's name or the selected form.
Here follows a list of the templates defined in Slimv.

USAGE                                                            *slimv-usage*

After proper installation start Vim and load a *.lisp source file into a
buffer. When the first Slimv command is entered (either from the menu or
via keyboard shortcut or entering a :call Slimv...() at the Vim command line)
then Slimv checks if the server/REPL runs and starts it if nedeed.
When the server is running, the Slimv commands send the appropriate Lisp
forms to the server/REPL for processing. That's it.

All you need to know then is the list of possible Slimv commands, how to
enter them and under what conditions.

FAQ                                                                 *slimv-faq*

- Q: Why is this plugin called 'Slimv'?
- A: Because it is trying to mimic the popular Emacs extension 'SLIME'.
     In SLIME 'E' stands for 'Emacs', so here it is replaced with 'V' as Vim.
     To tell the truth, first I gave the name 'Slimvim' to the plugin but
     then I found an (already abandoned) project called 'Slim-Vim' and I did
     not want to interfere with it.

- Q: Why another 'Superior Lisp Mode' if there is already one?
- A: Because many programmers prefer Vim as a program text editor over Emacs,
     including me. I don't want to start a holy war or whatsoever, I'm just
     happy if someone else finds this plugin useful.

- Q: How does Slimv work?
- A: Slimv consists of three parts: Vim plugin, client and server.
     The Slimv server is a swank server that embeds a Lisp REPL.
     The Slimv client interfaces with the server and is responsible
     for sending Lisp commands to the Lisp REPL.
     The Vim plugin is translating editor commands to Lisp commands to be
     sent to the server by the client.
     So the dataflow is like this:
     Vim -> Vim plugin -> Slimv client -> Slimv server -> Lisp REPL
     The plugin resides in 'slimv.vim', the client and the server both
     reside in 'slimv.py'.

- Q: Why is SLIME functionality XYZ missing from Slimv?
- A: There are two possible reasons:
     1. The dataflow of Slimv is one-directional: from client to server.
        There is no data sent back from the server to the client, so if a
        functionality requires that Slimv reads data from REPL, then
        currently it is not possible to implement it.
     2. It is possible to implement it, but I did not (yet) do it.
        Maybe future releases will contain it.

- Q: Why is the default port number 5151?
- A: Hint: what roman numerals are 5,1,5,1? Bingo: VI, doubled.

- Q: Are you a Lisp expert?
- A: No, not at all. I'm just learning Lisp. Also just learning Vim
     scripting. And I'm not a Python expert either, however (at the moment)
     I have more experience with Python than with Lisp.

- Q: Why using Python for the client/server code? Why not Lisp?
- A: This is for historical reasons and may change in the future.
     Preliminary versions used Vim's built-in Python support.
     Later on the client/server code was separated from Vim but still remained
     written in Python. On Linux this should not be a problem, most Linux
     distributions contain a Python interpreter with high enough version.
     On Windows this means, you need to install Python, if you don't have
     one (at least version 2.4). Anyway, Python is a nice language and
     also a perfect replacement for calculator.exe :-)

KNOWN ISSUES                                                     *slimv-issues*

- Needs Vim version 7.0 or above, because of the intensive use of lists.
- Vim register 's' is used for all form selections, so its original content is
  destroyed.
- (un)profile does not work
- Needs Python 2.4 or higher (uses the subprocess module)
- Works only via the Python interpreter, does not work using a Python IDE
  (like IDLE).

===============================================================================
TODO                                                               *slimv-todo*

- Rewrite client/server in Lisp, so that no Python would be needed.
- Add Compile System
- Add Cross Reference functions
- Add Profile functions
- Handle specific REPL output in Vim (like compilation notes)
- Use a Vim buffer for the REPL. This does not look possible with the current
  state of Vim, or at least I can not see any easy way to do it.
